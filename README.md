# predicting_honey_production

Honey Production Prediction Project
This project contains code for predicting honey production in the future based on historical data. The project uses linear regression to make predictions.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

Python 3
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip, the package installer for Python. To install the required packages, run the following command:

Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
Run the following command to execute the code:
Copy code
python honey_production_prediction.py
This will run the code and display a scatter plot of the historical honey production data as well as a line plot of the predicted honey production for the future.

Data
The historical honey production data used in this project is sourced from the Codecademy Data Science Path. The dataset contains information on honey production in the United States from 1998 to 2012.
